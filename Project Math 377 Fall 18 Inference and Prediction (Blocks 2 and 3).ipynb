    "This project is designed to cover many of the main ideas of the entire course. Ultimately we want to predict if an email is spam. In the course of doing this, we will collect data, clean it up, work with string data, make a simple inference, and then build a naive bayes model from the ground up. \n",

    "1. Find and import data.\n",

    "3. Determine if a word helps to identify an email as spam or not.\n",

    "5. Assess your model and propose improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect by displaying it.

The built-in join function from the `datascience` package only performs an inner joining. We need to perform an outer join. We cannot determine how to do this with the join function from `datascience` so let's convert the table to pandas dataframes and then perform an outer join, see https://www.shanelynn.ie/merge-join-dataframes-python-pandas-index-1/. By default, pandas repalces missing values with NaN, not a number. We must replace those missing values with 0. Finally, we can convert back to a datascience table."

    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a Bayesian classification method; these methods use Bayes' theorem. We explored this at the end of Section 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian classification, we're interested in finding the probability of a label given some observed features, which we can write as $P(L~|~{\\rm features})$.\n",
    "Bayes' theorem tells us how to express this in terms of quantities we can compute more directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(L~|~{\\rm features}) = \\frac{P({\\rm features}~|~L)P(L)}{P({\\rm features})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write $P({\\rm features})$ we mean a joint probability, for example $P({\\rm Free} \\cap {\\rm Get})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only the numerator that matters as the denominator will be the same in all calculations for the different labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are trying to decide between two labels—let's call them $L_1$ and $L_2$—then one way to make this decision is to compute the ratio of the posterior probabilities for each label:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{P(L_1~|~{\\rm features})}{P(L_2~|~{\\rm features})} = \\frac{P({\\rm features}~|~L_1)}{P({\\rm features}~|~L_2)}\\frac{P(L_1)}{P(L_2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the joint probability, $P(\\rm features)$, does not matter. If the ratio is greater than one, then $P(L_1~|~{\\rm features})$ is larger and you would select $L_{1}$ as the predicted outcome. You don't need to find the ratio, you simply need to find the maximum of $P(L_i~|~{\\rm features})$ for each label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need an algorithm to compute $P({\\rm features}~|~L_i)$ for each label. We could do a lookup table as we did in Section 6 but once we start adding many features this becomes too computationally expensive. The different assumptions about this calculation lead to the different types of Bayesian classifiers. In the naive Bayes model we make the assumption of conditional independence. This means within each label, for example a spam email, each word is independent of the others. This is clearly not going to be the case but the resulting model still has a practical use. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a naive Bayes classifier, we must only calculate the within label univariate density for continuous features, or probability mass for discrete features. The joint distribution is found by multiplying these univariate distributions. Once the univariate distributions have been estimated, the posterior calculaton is fast. For discrete text data, we only need to estimate the frequency of each word in each label. Then for multiple words we calculate the joint probability as the product of these individual probabilities. For example\n",
    "$$P({\\rm Free} \\cap {\\rm Get}~ | ~{\\rm Spam}) = P({\\rm Free}~ | ~{\\rm Spam})P({\\rm Get}~ | ~{\\rm Spam})$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some logistical issues to resolve. First, what if a word does not appear in a subject line? This would lead to a zero estimated probability and thus the joint probability would be zero as well. A solution to this problem is to use a psuedocount. This is determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P({\\rm Word}~ |~ {\\rm Spam}) = {\\mbox{Number of times Word appears in Subject line} + k \\over \\mbox{Number of Subject lines} +2k}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ does not need to be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, when we estimate the univariate probabilities, they tend to be small. If the subject has many words, then the product will be extrememly small. We can handle this by working with logarithms.\n",

    "The naive Bayes prediction method has much better accuracy than the simple model.  It also has a much better recall at almost 80% better, and the F1 score was also nearly 30% better.  However, the precision was down by almost 20%.  This lack of precision could have been for a number of reasons including the limited use of certain words that we chose to analyze.  The accuracy, however, is most important with only 14 false negatives (failure to detect spam and labeling it as ham).  Overall, the machine had a much better prediction ability."
